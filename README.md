## Key Features:

### 🚀 Capture in a Flash
Instantly save your idea and add an image. Your thoughts are always at your fingertips.

Our daily vote (Like, Dislike, Super Like) helps you intuitively see which ideas truly matter. You set the priorities, no fuss.

### 🤖 Enhance with AI
Get honest, constructive feedback from your AI assistant. Refine and develop your ideas without fear of harsh judgment or theft.

### ✅ Turn Ideas into Tasks
Break big ideas into small, manageable steps. Our task manager helps you focus on what's important without feeling overwhelmed.

Earn points for every action. Boost your ideas up the rankings! But remember: abandon an idea, and its points will burn. This is your fuel to act.
